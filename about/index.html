			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>"From a very early time, I understood that I only learn from things I don't like. If you do things you like, you just do the same sh@t. You always fall in love with the wrong guy. Because there's no change. It's so easy to do things you like. But then, the thing is, when you're afraid of something, face it, go for it. You become a better human being."Marina AbramoviÄ‡ </p>
